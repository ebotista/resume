In this course, I was tasked with building a game playing AI using minimax algorithm with heuristics and alpha-beta pruning. I implemented several search algorithms such as PriorityQueue, Breadth First Search, Uniform Cost Search, A* Search and Bi-directional Search. I implemented Bayesian networks to calculate the probability of discrete random variables.  I built, trained and tested decision tree models to perform basic classification tasks. I learned about image segmentation with k-means clustering to segment a color image and building a Gaussian mixture model to be trained with expectation-maximization and experimented with Bayesian information criterion. The final projects consisted of decoding Morse code using Hidden Markov Models.",
